			<h2>What is Moulding and Casting ?</h2>

      <p align="justify"><strong>Moulding:</strong>Moulding  is the process of manufacturing by shaping liquid or pliable raw material using a rigid frame called a mold or matrix.This itself may have been made using a pattern or model of the final object. A mold or mould is a hollowed-out block that is filled with a liquid or pliable material such as plastic, glass, metal, or ceramic raw material. The liquid hardens or sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. A mold is the counterpart to a cast. The very common bi-valve molding process uses two molds, one for each half of the object. Piece-molding uses a number of different molds, each creating a section of a complicated object. This is generally only used for larger and more valuable objects.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Casting:</strong>Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solidified part is also known as a casting, which is ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process. Casting materials are usually metals or various cold setting materials that cure after mixing two or more components together; examples are epoxy, concrete, plaster and clay. Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods.</p>

        <p align="justify"><strong>History Of Moulding and Casting</strong></p>
        <p align="jistify">
        <strong class="sub-headings">Introduction: </strong>Since the evolution of mankind, man has used his intelligence and creative instinct to develop things that will reduce his labour. He shaped bowls, tools and weapons out of stones and wood which was naturally found in nature.With the passage of time he discovered other element in nature like gold, silver and copper which were readily available in nature in the form of nuggets. He melted and shaped these metal according to his desires. He probably discovered gold pebbles with stone and copper from the copper bearing ores that line the fire pits. He found it easy to melt the iron, copper and gold using the firewoods and charcoal, and hence in differerent ages iron and copper became the most profusely used natural materials. <br />
         <br />
         <strong class="sub-headings">Evolution of casting process: </strong>          Gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, mercury and tin are known as the 'magnificent metals' since they were known to man from ancient times. The basic process of melting of metals in furnace, using patterns and soldifying the metal in mould has remained the same. Some ancient techniques like the lost form techniques and bell casting techniques are still religiously followed.<br />
         <br />
         <strong class="sub-headings" >Furnace</strong>:          The earliest furnace were simple and easy to operate, with beewax used for patterns and bellows for blowing air into the furnace. In the iron age probably ceramic ovens were used to melt the metals. Crucible and later flame ovens were available for the melting of copper, tin and lead alloys. <br />
         <br />
         <strong class="sub-headings">Molds:</strong>          <span>Diferent  types of mold made from clay, wax and loam were known from the early  times. The lost form technique was also prevalently used from the  early times. </span> <br />
         <br />
         <strong class="sub-headings">Patterms</strong>:
       The first patterns of casting were made probably 4000 years in mesoptoamical from beewax. A frog casted in copper is the oldest living proof of intricate patterns used as early as 3200 B.C. Core were also used to provide intricate to the interior of the cast. <br />
       <br />
       <strong class="sub-headings" >Different Ages of Casting:          </strong>According to Biblical records casting technology can be traced back to 5000 BC. It is possible that metal casting technology, using moulds originated in the Middle East. However, there are suggestions that this process may have been developed in India and China. It is said that the first steel products were made in India in 500 B. C., but the process was lost. The earliest records of casting methodology are the writings of monk Theophilus Presbyter in his book Schedula Diversarum Atrium. He has described in detail the casting of the famous Perseus and Head of Medusa. <br />
       <br />
       The Casting  is  a crucial factor that lead to the progress of each civilization.  The important ages of the prehistoric times is named after the metal  that was prevalently used in that age. Some of the important ages and  the relavance of casting in those ages are described below : <br />

Mankind found copper in the fires from copper-bearing ore that he lined his fire pits. Copper found an instant liking with man because it can be melted and molded into any desired form. So, using clay as mold and bee wax for pattern, he desinged householod good, weapon and religious times. The earliest living proof of copper was the weapon found with Otzi, the oldest naturally preserved mummy from 33000 B.C. Otzi carried a coper axe which seems to have been metalworked by the worker of his tribe. Archaeological evidence suggests that copper is among the earliest metals used by humans. Numerous digs all over the world indicate that copper was used to make utensils, jewelery, and weapons. Copper is highly ductile, meaning that it can be easily worked and pulled into wire. For cultures which had minimal or crude metalworking abilities, copper would have been easy to shape and work with.</td>

He found bronse favorable because it coule be use to make artefacts and toolls like knife, armor, pottery, that we more durable and harder. In the early part of the bronze age the naturally found bronze alloy was used, which has arsenic as an impurity. Tin bronze was used in the later part of the age, since it required sophisitcated techniques to melt and cast the products. Bronze age origninated in Turkey, Iran and Iraq which are known as the caradle of civilization.</td>

<center><img src="img/w12/a.png" alt="" width=650 ></center>
          <center>I imported the dxf file which is exported from inkscape to rihno</center>
<p>Which is a not a closed drawing and i was unable to make a soild out of it so have manullay draw to semi circles and i have trimmed them to make the moon like structure</p>

            <center>the final design for the machining on the wax</center>
            <p>I have created a solid modle out of it and saved it as .Stl</p>

<p><strong>Machining Wax in Modela</strong></p>
<p><strong> Rough cut</strong></p>
<p align="justify">The first step of making mold in modela starts with rough cutting. Rough cutting will remove large amount of materials, We can use different end mills for this. I have used a 1/16inch
	end mill for this. The raw material used is blue industrial grade wax, these are special purpose wax blocks for making molds for prototypes. Some specifications of the wax used is shown below.
	<ul>
		<li><a>Hardness: 53 (Shore "D" Scale) </a></li>
		<li><a>Melt Point (Ring & Ball Method): 240 degrees F (116C)</a></li>
		<li><a>Viscosity 270 degrees F = 1790cP</a></li>
		<li><a>Volumetric Shrinkage (for recycling, from melting point to room temp): 5% typical</a></li>
		<li><a>Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (in./in. ºF): 9.5 x 10-5</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
	<p align="justify">The wax is to be mounted over the base plate and rest of the settings are same like my <a href="week4.html" class="w3-btn w3-purple w3-round-large">electronics production week</a> documentation.
		 You can check the settings i have given in the image shown below. Here we are loading an stl file so first we may need to convert it to png from fab modules itself.
		The text and design in my design is small , so i selected 1/16 inch flat end mill for doing rough cut. The bits used for roughening and finishing is shown below.</p>

<center>Mold for the casting is ready</center>

            <h4><strong>Casting</h4></strong>

<p align="justify">Casting is a process in which a liquid material is poured into the mold and allowing it to harden.  In our lab we have different materials available for casting and are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.smooth-on.com/products/oomoo-25/">OOMO-25 - Liquid Silicone rubber</a>
	<li><a href="https://www.smooth-on.com/products/sorta-clear-37/">SORTA clear-37 - Translucent silicone rubbers</a>

				<li><a href="week12/plastic.pdf">High glossy transparent epoxy resign- Liquid plastic locally procured</a></li>
			</ul>
<br>
	<p align="justify">First we may need to make the negative mold of unicorn, So liquid silicone rubber can be used for this purpose.  Here we are going to use two part system, In two part system Part A & Part B will be there,
		One is a curing agent and other one is a resin. There are different casting techniques available and some of the intersting documentation sites i found useful are listed below.</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting_(metalworking)"> About Casting-Wikipedia</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://jason-webb.info/2012/09/overview-of-mold-making-and-casting-techniques-and-materials/">Casting techniques</a></li>
</ul>
	<p align="justify">I have used Liquid silicone rubber for casting, Which we procured locally its name is Liquid silicone rubber (LSR1) the technical document is also provided here. The main parameters
	are highlighted in the image. Mixing ratio of it is 100% Part A: 10% Part B, with a curing time of 24 hours. </p>

<h4><strong>Liquid Silicon Rubber casting</h4></strong>
	<p align="justify">We have to be ready with plastic cups, gloves, wooden stirrer sticks, Aluminium foils etc for casting. The very important step before doing casting is reading the technical document in detail, Once all
		the materials are ready we can start casting.  The image shown below is my casting setup.  Some materials will cause some helath issues, So must take the safety precautions.</p>
<center><img src="img/w12/1.jpg" alt="" width=650 ></center>
            <center>my image with mixing the casting material</center>
 <p><strong>Casting Steps</p></strong>
	<p align="justify">Here i will explain the steps i followed for casting the silicon rubber into my unicorn mold.</p>
	<p>Step:1</p>
	<p align="justify">First i cleaned the mold and filled the mold cavity with water to know approximate quantity required for casting. This is just an approaximate value because the density of water and the casting material
		won't be equal, but we will get an approaximate value. The water is weighted using a digital weight scale it showed 48.5 grams weight.</p>
<center><img src="img/w12/2.jpg" alt="" width=550 ></center>
<p><strong>Step:2</strong></p>
			<p align="justify">Now we can mix the material, for that taken 50 grams of Part A LSR1 material in a dry plastic glass from the LSR1 container.  Next we have to take 10% of Part B, 10% of part A is 5 grams, either
				we can take in a seperate glass or we can add to the Part A material glass itself. </p>
<p><strong>Step:3</strong></p>
<p align="justify">In this step we have to mix the two materials very well using the wooden stirrers, both Part A and Part B needs to be mixed correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Step:4</strong></p>
<p align="justify">In this step pour the mixed material in to the mold, here you have to be more careful that chances of airbubbles trapping is more in this stage. Pouring from small height is good method to avoid the air traps.
	 After pouring shake it carefully so that trapped air bubbles will come out of the mold or you can hit the entire mold on a flat surface slowly.</p>
<center><img src="img/w12/4.jpg" alt="" width=650 ></center>
<center>Pouring the silcon material into the mould</center><br><br>
<center><img src="img/w12/5.jpg" alt="" width=650 ></center>
<center>Damped and made the material settle without air bubbles</center><br>
<p>Step:5</p>
<p align="justify">After pouring the material we have to wait for 24 hours which is the setting time of the material, after that we can remove the negative mold from the wax mold and after a long waiting i got my negative mold
	as shown below.</p>
<center><img src="img/w12/6.jpg" alt="" width=650 ></center>
<p>We have <a href="https://www.rotometals.com/roto281f-low-melt-fusible-bismuth-based-alloy-ingot/">Low Melt Fusible Bismuth Based Alloy</a> in our fab lab inventory and it can be melted using the furnace.
	We had a vulcan furnace in our lab as shown below.</p>
<center><img src="img/w12/fur.png" style="height:550px;" alt="furnance"></center>

 <p align="justify">Breake the ignots using hammer and put it on the crucible, turn <code>ON</code> the furnace and keep the crucible inside of it and set the temperature around 400 degree celsius. Actually its melting point
	is 138.33 degree celsius or 281 Farad and if we melt the metal in higher temperature than the melting point then the viscosity may decrease and is good for casting thats why i put it to 400 degrees.  After reaching the
     temperature we can carefully take the crucible using the heat resistant gloves and tongs, then pour directly into the mold, the metal will get solid within few minutes.then i have put a string which i got from the used ear plug </p>
    <center><img src="img/w12/8.jpg" alt="" width=650 ></center>
    <p><strong>Plastic Casting</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Next i tried Plastic casting, Used high glossy epoxy resin we procured locally, the technical document is shown below. It is also a two part system with a mixing ratio of 100:60, having agel time of 10min and setting time of 30minutes.but it takes time to get strong around 24hrs as per my experience</p>
