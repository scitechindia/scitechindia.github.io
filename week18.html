			<h2>What  is Invention ?</h2>
      <p align="justify">
        An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process. The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process. It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result. An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough. Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field. An inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure.
</p>  <p align="justify">
Some inventions can be patented. A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention. The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary from country to country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.   
</p>      <p align="justify">

        <h2>What  is Intellectual Property ?</h2>
      <p align="justify">
        Intellectual Property (IP) refers to the protection of creations of the mind, which have both a moral and a commercial value.
</p>      <p align="justify">  
IP law typically grants the author of an intellectual creation exclusive rights for exploiting and benefiting from their creation. However, these rights, also called monopoly right of exploitation, are limited in scope, duration and geographical extent.
</p>      <p align="justify">  
IP protection is intended to stimulate the creativity of the human mind for the benefit of all by ensuring that the advantages derived from exploiting a creation benefit the creator. This will encourage creative activity and allow investors in research and development a fair return on their investment.
</p>      <p align="justify">  
IP confers on individuals, enterprises or other entities the right to exclude others from the use of their creations. Consequently, intellectual property rights (IPRs) may have a direct and substantial impact on industry and trade as the owner of an IPR may - through the enforcement of such a right - prevent the manufacture, use or sale of a product which incorporates the IPR.</p><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property" class="w3-btn w3-purple w3-round-large"> Also Read more</a></p>
        <h2>What  is Business Models ?</h2>
      <p align="justify">
          A business model is an "abstract representation of a business, be it conceptual, textual, and/or graphical, of all core interrelated architectural, co-operational, and financial arrangements designed and developed by an organization presently and in the future, as well as all core products and/or services the organization offers, or will offer, based on these arrangements that are needed to achieve its strategic goals and objectives. and in simple words 
       A business model is the way in which a company generates revenue and makes a profit from company operations. Analysts use the metric gross profit as a way to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of a firm's business model. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from revenues.
</p>  <p align="justify">
        A business model isn’t something you build from the ground up. When management-types ask about a business model — as in, “So what’s your business model?” — they really want an answer to a much more direct and basic question: “How do you plan to make money?”<br>

Behind the question of What is your Business Model?, is a lineup of other questions:<br>

        <li>Who’s your target customer?</li>
        <li>What customer problem or challenge do you solve?</li>
        <li>What value do you deliver?</li>
        <li>How will you reach, acquire, and keep customers?</li>
        <li>How will you define and differentiate your offering?</li>
        <li>How will you generate revenue?</li>
        <li>What’s your cost structure?</li>
        <li>What’s your profit margin?</li>

			<h2>Workflow of Choosing the License</h2>
<h4> FAB DATA Glass - <a href="project.html">FAB DG</a></h4>
            <p align="justify">My final project is a Fab Data Glass which consists of the sensors and display unit ,which shows the data infornt of the eye via refecting the display light through a Lens and falls on the reflector.I want to extend the project after academy to get the data from the companion mobile App. Now at this stage of academy i have to License this work. </p>
            <h3> Licensing</h3>
            <p align="justify">" Licensing means renting or leasing of an intangible asset. It is a process of creating and managing contracts between the owner of a brand and a company or individual who wants to use the brand in association with a product, for an agreed period of time, within an agreed territory." </p>
            <p align="justify">I have got the idea of making the Fab Data Glass from the Instructables Project Called Arduino Data Glass for Multimeter by <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Data-Glasses-for-My-Multimeter/">Alainsprojects</a> He Licesed his work under "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 Generic (CC BY-NC-SA 2.5)" ,and also he made the project opensource have mentioned in other platform hackaday.io under GNU General Public License version 3 Thus i love my project to be opensource and acessable.i have followed his idea ,but i have designed my own development board and sensor board for getting the input and output data. as part of this course i am going through multiple schemes of Lisens caluses . i will choose a lisense to my work by the end.</p>

            <p align="justify"> The MIT License is a free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is a permissive free software license, meaning that it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has therefore an excellent license compatibility. The MIT license permits reuse within proprietary software provided all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice. The MIT license is also compatible with many copyleft licenses, such as the GPL; MIT licensed software can be integrated into GPL software, but not the other way around.</p>
              <h3>License terms</h3>
            <p text align=justify>A common form of the MIT License (from the OSI's website, which is the same version as the "Expat License", and which is not identical to the license used in the X source code) is defined as:

The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative work can only be distributed under the same license terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.</p>

     <h2>Plan for Dissemination and choosing the Lisense</h2> 
        <p align="justify">I am not planning on commercilizing the project and it was created just for the learning purposes.

                    The licensor (me in this case) cannot revoke these freedoms as long as the person using the materials follow the license terms.</p>
                <p>The licence also provisions that the person using materials provided by me should <b>attribute</b> by giving appropriate credit, providing a link to the license, and indicating if changes were made.

                <p>The <b>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International </b> license is acceptable for <b>Free Cultural Works</b>, defined here <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition">http://freedomdefined.org/Definition</a>. The definition states that in order to be considered free, a work must be covered by a <b>Free Culture License</b>, or its legal status must provide the essential freedoms <b>(use and perform the work, study the work and apply the information, redistribute copies, distribute derivative works)</b>. Additionally, to be considered free the work has to: <b>provide source data, use a free format, be unrestricted techinically and unlimited in othe ways</b>.</p>


<h2>Future Development of the Project</h2>
        <p align="justify">There are several possibilities for enhancing the current project. One of the most necessary advancements is reducing size of the Design,It could be achieved with improving networking (using esp8266 or esp32) or even making one board with a different microcontroller. i will trying level best to improve the work after academy</p>
