				<h3>Raster Vs Vector</h3>
        <img src="img/w2/2_1.png" width="400" height="200" alt="Raster Vs Vector">
        <p align=justify>There are two main type of image files: Raster and Vector. Raster images are more common in general such as jpg, gif, png, and are widely used on the web. Vector graphics are common for images that will be applied to a physical product. Also used in CAD, engineering, and 3D graphics which we do not provide information nor services for.

When using a raster program you paint an image and it's similar to dipping a brush in paint and painting. You can blend colors to soften the transition from one color to another.

When using a vector program you draw the outline of shapes: e.g. an eye shape, a nose shape, a lip shape. These shapes display one single color each.</p>
<p align=justify>That means, when you try and scale the image into a larger size, the quality drops and the edges of lines become fuzzy (staircase effect). This is the major limitation of using raster images.

A vector image is composed of paths, which are represented by mathematical functions. These mathematical function represents the actual borders and the different elements in the image. Hence the maximum resolution of the image is not limited by the number of pixels. These mathematical functions can scale easily giving lossless ability to zoom to any extent on the image.

You can erase pixels in a raster image using the eraser tool but, that is not possible in a vector image. In a vector image you can only trim the path according to some constrains. </p>

<p>There are so many softwares which develops the Raster and Vector images</p>

			<h2>GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)</h2>
			<p align=justify> GIMP stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program (formerly General Image Manipulation Program), a free graphics editing package. It is typically used to do things like:
  <li>Create logos</li>
  <li>Resize graphics</li>
  <li>Create animated GIFs</li>
  <li>Touch up photos</li>
  <li>Export graphics to web format</li>
  <li>Scan photos</li>
  <li> Gimp is having its own features like Advanced scripting capabilities,Tile-based memory management, so image size is limited only by available disk space,Sub-pixel sampling for all paint tools for high-quality anti-aliasing etc.</p>

			<h2>Photoshop</h2>
			<p align=justify>Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows.
Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, it has become the de facto industry standard in raster graphics editing, such that the word "photoshop" has become a verb as in "to Photoshop an image," "photoshopping" and "photoshop contest", though Adobe discourages such use.[7] It can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models including RGB, CMYK, Lab color space, spot color and duotone. Photoshop has vast support for graphic file formats but also uses its own PSD and PSB file formats which support all the aforementioned features. In addition to raster graphics, it has limited abilities to edit or render text, vector graphics (especially through clipping path), 3D graphics and video. Photoshop's featureset can be expanded by Photoshop plug-ins, programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that can run inside it and offer new or enhanced features.
and it is so powerful software where it can easily build high reolution Raster images.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop" class="w3-btn w3-purple w3-round-large">Read More ...</a>

			<h2>My Paint</h2>
			<p align=justify>
        MyPaint began in 2004 when Martin Renold bought himself a Wacom graphics tablet. He noticed that the program he was using would sometimes drop a stroke when scribbling too fast. He thought he could be more expressive if his brush reacted in a different way to pressure and speed.

        mypaint-ss-1

        Martin wrote a few prototypes, and applied what he’d learned in his engineering studies. His simple program grew into a brush editor with a simple digital canvas. In 2006 Martin released version 0.4, and thought it was complete. MyPaint now did everything he wanted it to do, but artists found it and began to use it. Some of them asked for features that Martin also wanted, so development continued. Since then, many more have contributed to the code, or spread the word about MyPaint on the Internet.

        Fast-forward to today. MyPaint is a nimble, distraction-free, and easy tool for digital painters. It supports graphics tablets made by Wacom, and many similar devices. Its brush engine is versatile and configurable, and it provides useful, productive tools.<a href="http://mypaint.org/about/" class="w3-btn w3-purple w3-round-large">Read More ...</a>

  			<h2>Inkscape</h2>
  			<p align=justify>Inkscape is the only open vector developing software scalable vector graphics(SVG),The name is made up of the two English words "ink" and "scape". Ink is a common substance for drawings, and is used when the sketched work is ready to be permanently committed to paper, and thus evokes the idea that Inkscape is ready for production work. A scape is a view of a large number of objects, such as a landscape or ocean-scape, and thus alludes to the object-oriented nature of vector imagery.

    			<h2>3D Designing</h2>
    			<p align=justify> 3D computer graphics, 3D modeling (or three-dimensional modeling) is the process of developing a mathematical representation of any three-dimensional surface of an object (either inanimate or living) via specialized software. The product is called a 3D model. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena. The model can also be physically created using 3D printing devices.

                  <h2>Final project case 3D modeling</h2>
                  <p align=justify>Finally i have decided to use the Rhinoceros for the future use of the designng for all my projects .Rhinoceros is best software for the designers to build their designs and i had a great experience while using the Rhinoceros.i will be explaining step by step how i designed the final project case 3D Modeling.</p>
                      <p align=justify><strong>Step: 1</strong> I have opend the Rhinoceros modeling software and i took a rectangle shape tool just typing rectagle and i have drawn the rectangle. </p>

                    <center>Step 1 Drawing rectangle</center><br>
                      <p align=justify><strong>Step: 2</strong> Now i selected the extrudeCrv tool and slected the rectangle made and put a 5mm height to make a base.</p>
    <center><img src="img/w2/r/r2.png" width=80% height=auto></center><br>
                    <center>Step 2 creating solid rectangle</center><br>
     <p align=justify><strong>Step: 3</strong> Draw another rectangle inside with the gab between the first rectangle and second is around 5mm.</p>

                    <center>Step 3 Drawing another rectangle inside </center><br>
     <p align=justify><strong>Step: 4</strong> Now select the curves we wanted to extrude and press extrude curve.which will create open box with walls.</p>
    <center><img src="img/w2/r/r4.png" width=80% height=auto></center><br>
                    <center>Step 4 Extrude curve and create a wall</center><br>

                    <center>shaded view of the Box created with open top </center>
       <p align=justify><strong>Step: 5</strong>I have created another base using the process used in the step 1 and i have created circle and extruded the curve and i have done the boolean substraction command and i have substracted the cylinder from the base </p>
    <center><img src="img/w2/r/r6.png" width=80% height=auto></center><br>
                    <center>Create another base using copy paste.and extruded circle</center><br>
           <p align=justify><strong>Step: 6</strong> i have drawn a rectangle on the wall of the box and i have extruded the curve and i have made the boolean substraction to make a hole in the wall</p>

                    <center>Cutout hole in the box made with boolean substraction</center>
       <p align=justify><strong>Step: 7</strong> Adding up extruded letters using the text tool and creating the extruded font on the box top case</p>
