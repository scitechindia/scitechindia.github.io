			<h2>What is Embedded Systems ?</h2>
			<p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p align=justify>An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors are manufactured as components of embedded systems.
        </p><p align=justify>Examples of properties of typically embedded computers when compared with general-purpose counterparts are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost. This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with. However, by building intelligence mechanisms on top of the hardware, taking advantage of possible existing sensors and the existence of a network of embedded units, one can both optimally manage available resources at the unit and network levels as well as provide augmented functions, well beyond those available. For example, intelligent techniques can be designed to manage power consumption of embedded systems

      <h2>What is Embedded Programming ?</h2>
      <p align="justify">Embedded programming is a specific type of programming that supports the creation of consumer facing or business facing devices that don't operate on traditional operating systems the way that full-scale laptop computers and mobile devices do. The idea of embedded programming is part of what drives the evolution of the digital appliances and equipment in today's IT markets.Embedded programming is also known as embedded software development or embedded systems programming.
</p><p align="justify">Some experts define embedded programming as the dominant methodology for microcontroller programming. Essentially, embedded programming involves programming small computers that drive devices. In terms of its practical implementation, embedded programming is useful in the design of software for automotive features, small facilities-handling devices like thermostats, handheld games or other small devices.

  <h2>Microcontroller vs Microprocessor: Primary Differences<h2>

<p align="justify">Typically an MCU uses on-chip embedded Flash memory in which to store and execute its program. Storing the program this way means the MCU having a shorter start-up period and executing code quickly. The only practical limitation to using embedded memory is that the total available memory space is finite. Most Flash MCU devices available on the market have a maximum of 2 Mbytes of Program memory. This may prove to be a limiting factor, depending on the application.

</p><p align="justify">MPUs do not have memory constraints in the same way. They use external memory to provide program and data storage. The program is typically stored in non-volatile memory, such as NAND or serial Flash. At start-up, this is loaded into an external DRAM and execution commences. This means the MPU will not be up and running as quickly as an MCU but the amount of DRAM and NVM you can connect to the processor is in the range of hundreds of Mbytes and even Gbytes for NAND.
</p><p align="justify">Another difference is power. By embedding its own power supply, an MCU needs just one single voltage power rail. By comparison, an MPU requires several difference voltage rails for core, DDR etc. The developer needs to cater for this with additional power ICs / converters on- board.</p>
<p>Explained below is table for the difference between microprocessor and microcontroller.</p>

			<h2>Programming syntax and Data sheet</h2>
      <h3>Neils Lecture summary !</h3>
      <p align=justify>Our assignment for the week to understand and Read a microcontroller data sheet.Program your board to do something, with as many different programming languages and programming environments as possible.</p>
<p align="justify">Embedded C Programming is the soul of the processor functioning inside each and every embedded system we come across in our daily life, such as mobile phone, washing machine, and digital camera.</p>
<center><img src="img/w8/cpe.png" width=600 border=1></center>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<i>illusrated about the workflow </i>
</p>
<p align="justify">Each processor is associated with an embedded software. The first and foremost thing is the embedded software that decides functioning of the embedded system. Embedded C language is most frequently used to program the microcontroller.
  <p align="justify">Earlier, many embedded applications were developed using assembly level programming. However, they did not provide portability. This disadvantage was overcome by the advent of various high level languages like C, Pascal, and COBOL. However, it was the C language that got extensive acceptance for embedded systems, and it continues to do so. The C code written is more reliable, scalable, and portable; and in fact, much easier to understand.
</p>
  <h2>About C Language</h2>
  <p align="justify">C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1969. It is a collection of one or more functions, and every function is a collection of statements performing a specific task.
</p><p align="justify">  C language is a middle-level language as it supports high-level applications and low-level applications. Before going into the details of embedded C programming, we should know about RAM memory organization.
</p>
  <h3>Salient features of the language</h3>
  <li>C language is a software designed with different keywords, data types, variables, constants, etc.</li><li>
  Embedded C is a generic term given to a programming language written in C, which is associated with a particular hardware architecture.</li><li>
  Embedded C is an extension to the C language with some additional header files. These header files may change from controller to controller.</li><li>
  The microcontroller 8051 #include<reg51.h> is used.</li>
<p align="justify">The embedded system designers must know about the hardware architecture to write programs. These programs play prominent role in monitoring and controlling external devices. They also directly operate and use the internal architecture of the microcontroller, such as interrupt handling, timers, serial communication and other available features.
</p>

<p>The basic additional features of the embedded software</p>
<h3>Data types</h3>
<p align="justify"> The data type refers to an extensive system for declaring variables of different types like integer, character, float, etc. The embedded C software uses four data types that are used to store data in the memory.
</p><p align="justify"> The ‘char’ is used to store any single character; ‘int’ is used to store integer value, and ‘float’ is used to store any precision floating point value.
</p><p align="justify"> The size and range of different data types on a 32-bit machine is given in the following table. The size and range may vary on machines with different word sizes.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unsigned int</td>
    <td>2 byte</td>
    <td>0 to 65535</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Keywords</h3>

<p>There are certain words that are reserved for doing specific tasks. These words are known as keywords. They are standard and predefined in the Embedded C.</p>
<p>Keywords are always written in lowercase. These keywords must be defined before writing the main program. The basic keywords of an embedded software are given below:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<thead>
  <tr>

    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Function</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>sbit</td>
    <td>Accessing of single bit </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bit</td>
    <td>Accessing of bit addressable memory of RAM </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sfr</td>
    <td>Acessing of sfr register by another name</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>sbit:</strong> This data type is used in case of accessing a single bit of SFR register.

<li>Syntax: sbit variable name = SFR bit ; </li><li>
Ex: sbit a=P2^1;</li><li>
Explanation: If we assign p2.1 as ‘a’ variable, then we can use ‘a’ instead of p2.1 anywhere in the program, which reduces the complexity of the program.</li></p>

<p><strong>Bit:</strong> This data type is used for accessing the bit addressable memory of RAM (20h-2fh).

<li>Syntax: bit variable name;</li><li>
Ex: bit c; </li><li>
Explanation: It is a bit sequence setting in a small data area that is used by a program to remember something.</li></p>
<p><strong>SFR:</strong> This data type is used for accessing a SFR register by another name. All the SFR registers must be declared with capital letters.

<li>Syntax: SFR variable name = SFR address of SFR register;</li><li>
Ex: SFR port0=0x80;</li><li>
Explanation: If we assign 0x80 as ‘port0’, then we can use 0x80 instead of port0 anywhere in the program, which reduces the complexity of the program.</li></p>
<p><strong>SFR Register:</strong> The SFR stands for ‘Special Function Register’. Microcontroller 8051 has 256 bytes of RAM memory. This RAM is divided into two parts: the first part of 128 bytes is used for data storage, and the other of 128 bytes is used for SFR registers. All peripheral devices like I/O ports, timers and counters are stored in the SFR register, and each element has a unique address.

<p><strong>Comments:</strong> In embedded C programming language, we can place comments in our code which helps the reader to understand the code easily.</p>
<p>C=a+b; /* add two variables whose value is stored in another variable C*/</p>

<p><strong>Preprocessor directives:</strong> All the functions of the embedded C software are included in the preprocessor library like “#includes<reg51.h>, #defines”. These functions are executed at the time of running the program.
</p>
<h3>Global variable</h3>

<p>A global variable is a variable that is declared before the main function, and can be accessed on any function in the program.</p>
<code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap;">
    #include < reg51.h >
    sbit a=p1^5; /* global declaration*/
    void main()
    {
</code>
<p><center>Global Variable example</center></p>

<h3>Local variable</h3>

<p>A local variable is a variable declared within a function, and it is valid only to be used within that function.</p>
<code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap;">
    #include < reg51.h >
    void main()
    unsigned int k; /* local declaration*/
    a=0x00;
    while(1)
    {
</code>
<p><center>local Variable example</center></p>
<h3>Main () function</h3>
<p>The execution of a program starts with the main function. Every program uses only one main () function.</p>

<h3>Advantages of embedded C program</h3>
<li>Its takes less time to develop application program.</li><li>
It reduces complexity of the program.</li><li>
It is easy to verify and understand.</li><li>
It is portable in nature from one controller to another.</li>

    Inorder to compile in avr-gcc and flash the program on attiny44, we may need to run certain commands from the terminal. One of our instructor, Mr.Yadu has developed one User Interface in python language for easy compiling and flashing, it's called Compflash. Its available in the githublink, Compflash. I just cloned it in my PC. It requires certain dependancies, you can install it in your PC using commands. Once cloned,open terminal from the cloned directory, then type python compfalsh.py. It will open the GUI of comp flash like this.

    <h4>Programming using Arduino IDE</h4>

<p>Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board. There are a large collection of tutorials are available on Arduino, out of which ,I found the following tutorial is good to know more about Arduino. </p>

<p>Ardunio is basically AVR C with an extra layer on top of it. For beginners like me Arduino is relatively easier to learn than AVR C.  This is because in the Arudino IDE most of the common tasks we have to do are written as functions and stored in the Arduino library. This makes it easier for beginners as all we have to is call the right functions and the program will work accordingly. But a downside of this is that, the chip will work much slower than if it was programmed with AVR C the reason is that Arduino loads a lot of unused libraries into the chip which will waste many clock cycles. Another problem is the size of the program itself, this will be much larger in comparison with AVR C program. </p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux#toc2"> Installing Arduino</a> in Linux, I plan to program my board using Fab ISP through arduino IDE. Arduino IDE supports all default Arduino boards, but in order to work with external boards, we have to first add the boards through the board manager.</p>

<p>You can follow this <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux#toc2">   tutorial </a>to add the Attiny44 board to the Arduino IDE. </p>
<p align="justify">Here are the steps,
<li>Open the preferences dialog in the Arduino software.</li><br>
<li>Find the “Additional Boards Manager URLs” field near the bottom of the dialog.</li><br>
<li>Paste the following URL into the field (use a comma to separate it from any URLs you’ve already added):<br>
<code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json</code></li><br>
<li>Click the OK button to save your updated preferences.</li><br>
<li>Open the boards manager in the “Tools > Board” menu.</li><br>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the list; you should see an entry for “ATtiny”.</li><br>
<li>Click on the ATtiny entry. An install button should appear. Click the install button.</li><br>
<li>Close the boards manager. You should now see an entry for ATtiny in the “Tools > Board” menu.</li><br>
    </p>


<p><figure><img class="img-responsive" src="img/w8/ardu.png" alt="Embedded programming "><figcaption></figcaption>Blinking LED using Arduino IDE.</figure></p>

<p>Now you have successfully added the board, you can begin programming.</p>




<p>Arduino has some example programs to get you started. I went through the LED blink program and edited the source code. I changed the pins of the program to correspond to the pins on my board after referring the Arduino pin out diagram of ATtiny. The program was flashed successfully after burning the Arduino bootloader.   </p>

<p><figure><img class="img-responsive" src="img/w8/arled.png" alt="Embedded programming "><figcaption></figcaption>Blinking LED using Arduino IDE.</figure></p>

<p>The program size was 952 bytes, When compared to the same program written in AVR C (457 bytes), is almost double. This is the extra overhead I talked about when using Arduino. Its useful for prototyping quick projects but not suitable for running finished products.</p>
